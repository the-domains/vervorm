# Me, myself and I

Hi, this site is about me,**Steven Verhoest**, a freelance **User Interface **designer.

And this grid thing is nothing what I expected. Totally not useable!!!!

It sucks...............................maybe in a year of 2.........................who knows.

I want you to know that I tried to put as much as possible in this website concerning myself and my knowledge. It's not just about the content but also about the underlying technology I used to build this site, the pictures I used, etc. Every aspect of this site tells something about me as a person and as a User Interface designer/developer.

I studied industrial design, which I finished with distinction, in 1990\. I have always known that I was **passionate about technology, computers and design**. That's is also the reason why I immediately jumped on the internet wagon from the first moment (mid nineties) it came available in our regions (Flanders - Belgium). I started my web career at the 2 major web agencies at the time: "The Reference" and "e-Com".

By now I have more than 10 years of experience in the field but I still learn new things every day. The industry keeps on pushing new technologies and I'm more than **eager **to absorb as much as possible. Thanks to my experience I can assimilate these technologies pretty fast and harness their potential for myself and my clients benefits.
