# Don't make me think

> Or why "not having to think" is **sooo important **for you, me and by the way for **your site**.

**"Don't Make Me Think"**
. It comes from the wonderful book "Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability" by

I follow this way of thinking as close as possible. Approaching the user in this manner, finds its roots in industrial design and ergonomics. This is a perfect example how industrial design and web design have a common ground.

The web is these days all about the**end-user and the user-experience**. But don't make your site fancy for the sake of having a lot of whoosh and bling bling. The user doesn't want to **RTFM(\*)**so your web application or site**has to be crystal clear**. The user needs to find immediately what he wants and what he's interested it without thinking.

(\* RTFM = Read The F\*\*\*'n Manual)
