# Size does matter

Forms follows function but the looks of your site or application does matter. No? Before you read this you have to read the part about "Don't make me think". Because the looks of a site are of course extremely important. But it has to be, before all functional. As a designer, I try to find this thin line between looks and functionality. I will use proven usability semantics and merge them with the look and feel that's appropriate for your website or web application. Check out my "Eye candy" or "The truth is out there" and see for yourself what I'm capable of or what I think is good web design.
