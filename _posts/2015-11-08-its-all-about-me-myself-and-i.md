Hi, this site is about me, Steven Verhoest, a freelance User Interface designer. I want you to know that I tried to put as much as possible in this website concerning myself and my knowledge. It's not just about the content but also about the underlying technology I used to build this site, the pictures I used, etc. Every aspect of this site tells something about me as a person and as a User Interface designer/developer.
